Smart assistant app for paddy cultivators 2024 Our innovative Paddy Cultivators mobile application is designed to assist farmers by providing essential tools for monitoring and managing their crops. Tailored to help farmers optimize yield and quality, this application covers four critical components: Blight Disease Identification: Early identification of blight diseases (Bacterial Blight or Sheath Blight) and severity analysis to mitigate crop loss. Blast Disease Monitoring: Detection and management of blast disease in paddy fields to reduce its impact on crop yield. Rice Quality Analysis: Automated assessment of rice quality based on key parameters to ensure market readiness and competitiveness. Price Prediction for Cultivators: Price forecasting for paddy crops, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about when to sell their produce for maximum profit.
