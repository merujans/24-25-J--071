-----Rice Quality Analysis Using Image Processing-------------------------------------
Welcome to the Rice Quality Analysis project repository! This project focuses on developing a system for analyzing rice grain quality using image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify rice grains based on their visual characteristics, identify defects, and ensure high-quality outputs for agricultural stakeholders.

-----------------Features--------------------------------------
Image Preprocessing: Resizing, denoising, and normalizing rice grain images.
Defect Detection: Identifies defects such as cracks, discoloration, and broken grains.
Feature Extraction: Analyzes size, shape, texture, and color of rice grains.
Classification: Categorizes rice into high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality classes.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes ML models for accurate predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Displays results and quality assessment metrics.
System Workflow
Input: Capture images of rice grains using a camera or scanner.
Preprocessing: Clean and normalize images for analysis.
Defect Detection: Analyze images for cracks, discoloration, or broken grains.
Feature Extraction: Extract key attributes like size, shape, and texture.
Classification: Use machine learning models to categorize rice quality.
Output: Generate a detailed report on rice grain quality.
